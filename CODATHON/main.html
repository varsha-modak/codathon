    <h2><strong>CROSS FIT</strong></h2>
    <p>
        Hello! people.
        Cross fit welcomes you to transform and stregthen you.Whether you're a gym rat or not, it's always nice to think healthy. Which is why we've taken it upon ourselves to present you with some of the coolest workout spaces in our country.
        Please note that we're not talking about just another gym, which you'll find pretty much in every nook and corner of every city; 
       </p>
       <p id="gym">
        <em>Cross fit</em> actually pumps out extra oxygen from their AC, which in turn helps to keep energy levels up and increases your stamina. Beat that? The ambiance has a nightclub vibe to it with purple velvet walls, gold fashioned iron frames with huge mirrors (for the self-obsessed) and a huge disco ball themed DJ booth. Nitrro is SoBo's largest gym in 20,000 sq ft.

        The gym offers aerobics, dance, yoga, spinning, sports rehab, nutrition, physiotherapy, and personal training. A Cr√®che facility is also available for moms or dads who do not have help at home and need to get their kids along to the gym.
